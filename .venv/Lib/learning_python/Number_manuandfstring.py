bmi = 200/1.64**2
print(bmi)#output is 74.36049970255802
#if we have only 5 digit plcae holder in our code to make it 5 digit we can use
print(int(bmi))#output is 74 but it is flooring to int
print(round(bmi))#will round it to nearest int
print(round(5.1))#output 5
print(round(5.6))#output is 6
print(round(bmi,4))#output is 74.3605 rounds after 4 decimal digits
print(round(9.199999,2))#output is 9.2
